# ðŸ§© Maze Agent Exercise

## Overview

In this exercise, you will build a simple software agent (a program) that can navigate a maze by interacting with a REST API. The agent will not see the whole maze at onceâ€”it will only know its current position and the status of the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) after each move.

Your goal is to write a client that can reach the exit of the maze by making a series of valid moves.

## API Endpoints

### 1. Start a New Maze Session

**Request:**  
`POST /api/maze/start`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "sessionId": "string",
  "position": [0, 0],
  "surroundings": {
    "up": "wall",
    "down": "wall",
    "left": "wall",
    "right": "free space"
  }
}
```
- `sessionId`: Unique ID for your game session.  
- `maze`: The full maze layout (for debugging; your agent should not use this to cheat!).  
- `position`: Your starting coordinates.  
- `surroundings`: What is in each direction from your current position.

### 2. Make a Move

**Request:**  
`POST /api/maze/move`

**Body:**
```json
{
  "sessionId": "string",
  "direction": "up" | "down" | "left" | "right"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "position": [x, y],
  "status": "ok" | "wall" | "end",
  "surroundings": {
    "up": "wall",
    "down": "free space",
    "left": "wall",
    "right": "exit"
  }
}
```
- `position`: Your new position (or unchanged if you hit a wall).
- `status`:  
  - `"ok"`: Move successful.  
  - `"wall"`: You hit a wall; position unchanged.  
  - `"end"`: You reached the exit!
- `surroundings`: What is in each direction from your new position.

---

## Your Task

1. **Start a new session** by calling `/api/maze/start`. Save the `sessionId`.
2. **Write a program (agent)** that:
    - Sends moves to `/api/maze/move` using the `sessionId`.
    - Decides which direction to move based only on the `surroundings` field in the response.
    - Repeats until it reaches the exit (`status: "end"`).
3. **(Optional)**: Try to implement a smarter agent that finds the shortest path!

---




## Rules

- You may only use the `surroundings` field to decide your next move.
- Only one move is allowed per API call.
- If you hit a wall, your position does not change.
- The goal is to reach the exit cell (`"E"`).

---

## Challenge

- Can you write an agent that always finds the exit, no matter where it starts?
